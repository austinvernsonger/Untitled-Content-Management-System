= A brief Introduction to CMS from Scratch =

== Introduction ==

CMSfromScratch is a lightweight (3MB) highly extensible content management system that does not rely upon databases, but instead uses flat text files (encrypted) for data storage. CMS from Scratch uses a web based interface for both the designer and the client, enabling them to create and edit pages, upload content and easily develop and integrate new functionality. CMS from Scratch is especially good at converting existing static HTML only sites into dynamic, content managed sites at great speed
